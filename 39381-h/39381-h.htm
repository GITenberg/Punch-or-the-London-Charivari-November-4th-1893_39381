<h2 class="sans">SELF-HELP.</h2>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;Am sick of paying all these
doctor's bills. Have just seen an advertisement
of <i>The Domestic Doctor, a Dictionary
of Medicine</i>, issued in monthly parts. The
very thing for a man like me, somewhat
delicate. Hasten to secure Part I. Shall
now be able to doctor myself and save all
fees. Delightful! To celebrate emancipation
ask <span class="sc">Jones</span> and <span class="sc">Robinson</span> to dinner at
club. No need for economy now. Jolly good
dinner. That club port is excellent.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Feel rather seedy. Pain in
head. No appetite. Just the time to make
use of <i>Domestic Doctor</i>. Capital book.
Hullo! Well, I'll be hanged! Never
thought of that. The beastly thing's alphabetical,
and only gets to "Chilblain." No
good to look out "Headache." Ah, perhaps
"Ache." No go. "Appetite?" But appetite
isn't a disease, except in men like
<span class="sc">Banting</span>. Absolutely no use whatever.
Still, will not be conquered. Shall get
another part in a month. Until then take
great care only to have complaints up to Ch.
Can always fall back on Chilblain. Take
it easy, with B. and S. in moderate doses
when required, and begin to feel better.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Just cut my finger. Feel
somewhat nervous. Remember vaguely that
lock-jaw often follows a wound on the
hand. Ha! My dictionary. "Cuts." Ah,
no. "Cuts" come after "Chilblain." They
will be in Part II. Bandage wound, and
prepare for the worst. Sit with mouth wide
open as best attitude for approaching lockjaw.
Can then at least be fed. If, however,
it really comes, shall be dead before
Part VII. of the Dictionary is out. Anyhow,
will not send for a doctor.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Hooray! Finger and jaw both
well. Somehow left boot feels uncommonly
tight. Can't walk at all. That fool <span class="sc">Phust</span>
has made this pair too narrow. Feels as
though there were something on my toe. By
Jove, so there is! Where's the Dictionary?
Chilblain? Can't be a chilblain this mild
weather. Of course not; it's a corn. Look
out "Corn." Oh, hang it, just too far!
But, bright idea, perhaps it's a bunion.
Look out "Bunion." Hullo, what's this?
"Bunion, see Corn." Well, of all the confounded&mdash;&mdash;Positively
can't walk till next
month. Lie on sofa under open window to
get as much air as possible. Fall asleep.
Heavy shower comes on. Get quite wet.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Sneezing like mad, and coughing.
Blow my cough! Blow my nose! No
good looking out "Cold" or "Cough" in
Dictionary, unless&mdash;of course "Catarrh."
Seize my priceless treasure, and read,
"Catarrh, Latin <i>catarrhus</i>, from Greek"&mdash;oh,
hang the derivation!&mdash;"an affection of
the mucous membrane, commonly called a
cold. See Cold." Foiled again! Must do
what I can with domestic remedies till
Part II. comes out. Fires, hot grog, hot bath,
hot gruel, lots of blankets. Nearly suffocated.</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;Very much worse. Awful
cough. Sit close to fire wrapped in thick
dressing-gown. <span class="sc">Jones</span> looks in. "Hullo,
old man," he says, "what's wrong? Seedy?"
I choke out some answer. "Why don't you
send for the doctor?" In my indignation
nearly burst my head with coughing. At last
show him Dictionary, and write on scrap of
paper, "Can you suggest some complaint
like mine beginning with A or B, or C up to
Ch?" Impetuous fellow, <span class="sc">Jones</span>. Starts off
wildly&mdash;"Influenza, Pneumonia, Pleurisy,
Diphtheria, Sore Throat, Inflammation of the
Lungs&mdash;&mdash;" Then I manage to stop him, and
to gasp, "Up to C." "No difficulty about
that," says he. "Cold. Cough&mdash;&mdash;" I shake
my head feebly. "Well, then, Bronchitis."
Of course. The very thing. Look it out.
"Bronchitis, from Greek"&mdash;blow the derivation!&mdash;"inflammation
of the membrane of
the bronchia. This serious disease requires
skilled attention. Keep the patient warm,
and send at once for a medical man." What
a miserable swindle, when I hoped to save
all doctor's fees! Was warm before. Simply
boiling with indignation now. Pass the book
to <span class="sc">Jones</span> in speechless disgust. "Quite right
too," he remarks; "just what I said.
Capital book! I'll send the doctor as I go
home." And so he does, in spite of my protests.
Doctor comes and lays his head on my
chest. Then he says, cheerfully, "Only a
little cough. You'll be all right to-morrow.
What's that you say? Bronchitis? Bosh!"</p>

<h3>DAMON OUT OF DATE.</h3>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Here is the lovely summer going by,</p>
<p>And we know nought about it, you and I,</p>
<p class="i4">Being so far away</p>
<p>One from the other; yet to outward eye</p>
<p class="i4">We both are summer gay.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And people talk; although no pulses stir</p>
<p>However much I laugh and dance with her,</p>
<p class="i4">My temporary fate;</p>
<p>And you, perhaps as carelessly, prefer</p>
<p class="i4">That one your will to wait,</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Who, the dance over, from his strict embrace</p>
<p>Gallantly frees you, mops his sun-tanned face,</p>
<p class="i4">And asks in accents low</p>
<p>Whether you'd like an ice, or what, in case</p>
<p class="i4">You breathe a doubtful "No."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Oh, the striped awning and the fairy lamp,</p>
<p>The cool night fragrance, the insidious damp,</p>
<p class="i4">And, more insidious still,</p>
<p>The sweet effrontery of the beardless scamp</p>
<p class="i4">Who babbles at his will.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Here, by the sea, which in the darkness sings,</p>
<p>On the free breeze I give my fancy wings,</p>
<p class="i4">And in a sudden shrine</p>
<p>Your image throned appears, while the wind swings</p>
<p class="i4">Its sea-incense divine.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Breathless I worship in the waiting night</p>
<p>The sparkling eyes, that sometimes seem all light,</p>
<p class="i4">The cheek so purely pale,</p>
<p>The sacred breast, than whitest dress more white,</p>
<p class="i4">Where whitest thought must fail.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Thin arms, with dimpled shadows here and there,</p>
<p>The curl'd luxuriance of your soft, dark hair</p>
<p class="i4">Its own bewitching wreath,</p>
<p>And perfect mouth that shows, in smiles too rare,</p>
<p class="i4">The radiant little teeth.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>You cannot live on dances and delights,</p>
<p>Or fêtes by day and dance-music by nights.</p>
<p class="i4">Time foots it fleeter far</p>
<p>Than all the surging crowd your beauty smites</p>
<p class="i4">Like some coruscant star.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>The ruthless social dragon will not spare</p>
<p>Your sweet girl nature, withering in the glare,</p>
<p class="i4">Or peeping out by stealth.</p>
<p>Wealth's prize is beauty, and to make all fair,</p>
<p class="i4">Beauty's desire is wealth.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>I cannot keep a carriage for you, dear;</p>
<p>No horses on three hundred pounds a year</p>
<p class="i4">My lacking stables grace.</p>
<p>Yet the swift Hansom to the whistle clear</p>
<p class="i4">Will always speed apace.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>I cannot give you wines of vintage rare,</p>
<p>There is no room for them beneath the stair</p>
<p class="i4">Which is my cellar's space.</p>
<p>Yet with Duke <span class="sc">Humphrey</span> we could often fare</p>
<p class="i4">With more than ducal grace.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Ah, loves, like books, are fated from the first,</p>
<p>One gets no cup of water for the thirst</p>
<p class="i4">The whole stream would not slake;</p>
<p>Another dims with tears the springs that burst</p>
<p class="i4">To sunshine for his sake.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>When this vain fervour sadly sobers down,</p>
<p>I'll love you still, white maid, with eyes so brown</p>
<p class="i4">And voice so passing sweet,</p>
<p>And haply with Apollo's laurel crown</p>
<p class="i4">My love's foredoomed defeat.</p>

<h3>NOTE BY OUR OWN PHILOSOPHER.</h3>

<p>The breakfast-eating practical
joker, who can be credited with
the humorous invention of placing
the shell of an egg (the edible
contents of which he has previously
extracted and swallowed)
inverted in an egg-cup, so as
to deceive the first hungry person
arriving late into fancying that
the others have considerately deprived
themselves in order that
he may not be without his favourite
delicacy, this originator, I say,
was decidedly a genius. His work
after hundreds, nay, thousands of
years, remains, fresh as is the
new laid egg itself! After being
used a million billion times, it
gives now the same pleasure as
ever it did when it first issued
from the brain of its brilliant
creator! Such a practical joke
as this is "not for an age, but for
all time," until there shall be no
longer left a hen to lay an egg,
or, if there be an egg left by the
expiring hen, there shall be no
longer a person remaining to eat
the egg left by the egg-spiring
hen; or, if the person and the
egg be there, the last man and
the last egg, there shall be no ten
minutes allowed for refreshment,
as there will be no more time for
anything!! <span class="sc">Socrates</span>, <span class="sc">Homer</span>,
<span class="sc">Ovid</span>, <span class="sc">Horace</span>, <span class="sc">Plautus</span>, <span class="sc">Terence</span>,

<span class="sc">Isaac Newton</span>, <i>cum multis aliis</i>!
their names are remembered, and
their fame is to the end of the
world! While, alas, the name of
the True Wit who first chuckled
over his stroke of genius, is lost
for ever, no work of art perpetuates
his name. But his humour
is <i>usque ad finem omnium rerum</i>!</p>

use, really. Rather out of my line this sort of thing, you know!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> I'm sure you
must know more about it
than Miss <span class="sc">Toovey</span> and I

usual business&mdash;drinkin'

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> There, you see,

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> I suppose that's
intended as a satire on noisy
young men, isn't it, Captain
<span class="sc">Alchin</span>?</p>

<p><i>Captain Alch.</i> (<i>who
hadn't thought of it in
that light</i>). Well&mdash;ha&mdash;that
depends on how you
<i>take</i> it, don't you know.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> That's the way
<i>I</i> shall take it, and then it's
quite moral. (<i>A Low Comedian,
in a broad-brimmed
hat and a rough black wig,
makes his appearance</i>.)
This must be <span class="sc">Walter
Wildfire</span>, I suppose. <span class="sc">Thea</span>, do you see? he looks <i>quite</i> nice, and
not really vulgar. Now he's going to sing. Isn't he too delightfully
funny! What, <span class="sc">Frank</span>? Not <span class="sc">Wildfire</span>? Mr. <span class="sc">Alf Redbeak</span>.
Are you <i>sure</i>? I was wondering what there could possibly be in such a
common little man as that to make such a fuss about. And <i>what</i>
language? Captain <span class="sc">Alchin</span>, what <i>does</i> he mean by saying that he
was "dotted on the crust by a copper," and "went off his onion"?</p>

<p><i>Capt. Alch.</i> (<i>who foresees rocks ahead if he once undertakes to
interpret</i>). Oh, well, they're always inventin' some new slang, you
know, Mrs. <span class="sc">Merridew</span>; no use tryin' to keep up with it.</p>

<p class="ind2">
[Miss <span class="sc">Cissie Cinders</span> <i>appears as a bedraggled maid of all work,
and sings a doleful ditty to the effect that</i>&mdash;"Her missis will
not let her wear no feathers in her 'at, so her sojer's gone
and given 'er the chuck."</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> (<i>delighted</i>). Isn't she refreshing&mdash;so <i>deliciously</i> vulgar!
I do hope she hasn't finished. <span class="sc">Thea</span>, you're sitting as quiet as a
little mouse in that corner. I hope you're not too dreadfully shocked?
<i>I'm</i> not&mdash;at least of course I am, really; but it's not nearly so bad
as I expected.</p>

<p><i>Althea.</i> Oh, I'm not in the least shocked, <span class="sc">Cissie</span>, thanks; only I
don't quite understand it all.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> My dear, no more do I. I don't understand <i>any</i> of it&mdash;but
that makes no difference!</p>

<p><i>Alth.</i> (<i>To herself</i>). I don't like to say so, but I <i>am</i>
disappointed. Mr.
<span class="sc">Curphew</span> said it would be like a Penny Reading; but it's not a bit, it's
ever so much stupider. But he never goes himself, so of course&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> It's quite a respectable audience; I thought we should
be the only people in evening dress, but we're not. I do wish they
wouldn't allow quite so much smoking, though; the atmosphere's
getting something too awful. Oh, <span class="sc">Thea</span>, do look in that box just
opposite. Can you see through that lace curtain? Ah, you can't
see now!</p>

<p><i>Alth.</i> (<i>looking round the edge of the curtain</i>). Where,
<span class="sc">Cissie</span>, who
is it?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Why, quite the typical British Matron&mdash;<i>the</i> most
tremendously proper-looking
person; so if <i>she</i>
doesn't see any harm in
being here, I'm sure we
needn't. I'll tell you when
she pops her her head out
again. There, quick! <span class="sc">Thea</span>,
quick! Did you see her
that time?</p>

<p><i>Alth.</i> (<i>faintly</i>). Y&mdash;yes.
I&mdash;I saw her <i>that</i> time. (<i>To
herself.</i>) Is this a wicked
conscience&mdash;or what? It
was <i>so</i> like Mamma! But
how could it be?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Did you <i>ever</i> see
such a grim old frump,
<span class="sc">Thea</span>? I wonder what
possessed her to come to
a place like this? She
doesn't look as if it was
amusing her much.</p>

<p><i>Alth.</i> (<i>distractedly</i>).
Doesn't she? (<i>To herself.</i>)
If it <i>should</i> be
Mamma! If she has found
out in some way that we
were to be here to-night
and followed us! But how
<i>could</i> she know? Suppose
she were to see me, and&mdash;and
come round and fetch me
away; how awful it would
be! But she can't see me
through these curtains. I
don't believe it <i>is</i> Mamma.
I&mdash;I wish I dared look
again. Oh, why did I get
<span class="sc">Cissie</span> to bring me here?</p>

<p><i>Capt. Alch.</i> May I borrow
your opera glass for a
moment, Mrs. <span class="sc">Merridew</span>?
Thanks, awf'ly. (<i>As he
looks through it.</i>) There's
goin' to be a row in that
opposite box. Your British
Matron's gettin' her quills
up&mdash;give you my word she is.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Oh, do let me
see! (<i>She holds out her
hand for the glass, which</i>
Capt. A. <i>surrenders</i>.) Yes, I do believe you're right. Somebody's just
come in and&mdash;&mdash;Now there's another, a young man, and&mdash;oh, <span class="sc">Thea</span>!</p>

<p><i>Alth.</i> (<i>in an agony</i>). What is it, <span class="sc">Cissie</span>? <i>do</i> tell
me! (<i>To herself.</i>)
It must be <span class="sc">Charles</span>&mdash;I'm sure it's <span class="sc">Charles</span>. Then <i>that</i>'s
why&mdash;and
it <i>is</i> Mamma! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Mayn't I have the glass?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> I think you had better not, dear. The British Matron
has boxed the poor young man's ears&mdash;she has really. I wonder
what&mdash;but well, it doesn't matter. Now she's turned him out of
the box. He's coming back&mdash;alone. Yes, the old lady has certainly
gone&mdash;it's all over. I'm <i>so</i> sorry; it was ever so much more interesting
than that big fat man who's singing!</p>

<p><i>Alth.</i> (<i>tremulously</i>). Mayn't I look now, <span class="sc">Cissie</span>, if it's
all over?
(<i>She almost snatches the glass, and directs it at the young man in
Box C&mdash;then to herself, with relief.</i>) Why, it isn't <span class="sc">Charles</span>&mdash;it's
not even like him. Then&mdash;oh, what a goose I've been! It wasn't
Mamma either. It was all my fancy, and she had on rather the same
kind of bonnet. As if Mamma would come to a music-hall and box
the ears of somebody she didn't know! But <i>what</i> a fright it gave
me!</p>

<p class="ind2">
[<i>She begins to feel capable of enjoying the performance.</i></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[pg 209]</span>

<p><i>Col. Merridew</i> (<i>later</i>). Now we're going to see the great man,
<span class="sc">Cecilia</span>. <span class="sc">Wildfire's</span> down to sing next.</p>

<p><i>Capt. Alch.</i> Don't you be too sure, <span class="sc">Frank</span>. They haven't put
the number up yet, you see. As likely as not they'll put in an
"extra turn," and he won't come at all. I've known that happen
lots of times when you come on purpose to see somethin', don't you
know.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> Really, Captain <span class="sc">Alchin</span>, I shall begin to suspect that
you are more of an authority about music-halls than your modesty
would admit at first.</p>

<p><i>Capt. Alch.</i> (<i>in some confusion</i>). No, really now, Mrs.
<span class="sc">Merridew</span>,
all I mean is <span class="sc">Wildfire's</span> bringin' out a play or somethin' to-night
at the Hilarity, so he mayn't be able to turn up here, don't you see.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> I won't have you predicting evil like that; it's not at
all nice of you, and you're quite wrong, too; for there's his number
in the frame now!</p>

<p class="ind2">
[<i>The Scene on the Stage changes once more from an Oriental
Palace to a London Street; a bell tingles; the Orchestra
dashes into the air of</i> "The Hansom Cabman," <i>which the
bulk of the audience hail with delight; then a stream of
limelight is thrown on the boards, and</i> <span class="sc">Walter Wildfire</span>
<i>appears</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> (<i>after the first verse</i>). I don't know what it is, but
there's something about him very different from all the others. And
they say he writes all his own songs and music&mdash;so clever of him!
Quite a striking face he has, rather handsome, with that drooping
moustache. Don't <i>you</i> think he's handsome, <span class="sc">Thea</span>? (<span class="sc">Althea</span>
<i>does not answer</i>; <span class="sc">Wildfire</span> <i>sings the last verse; as he
concludes, the house is hushed for an instant, and then breaks into a thunder of
applause</i>.) It's quite beautiful that last verse; poor, poor fellow!
it all seemed so real, somehow! Ah, he's not going to sing the last
verse again. I'm rather glad, for I very nearly howled, and it would
be too silly to cry at a music-hall. (<i>Interval.</i>) Here he is again; how
different he looks. I suppose it's the sandwich-boards. (<span class="sc">Wildfire</span>
<i>goes through the second song with the small child; in the midst of
the second stanza, he suddenly falters, and only recovers himself by
a violent effort</i>; <span class="sc">Althea</span> <i>has bent forward out of the shadow of
the curtain</i>.) It's too frightfully pathetic; he's such a dear, isn't he?
(<i>The applause is more rapturous than ever; an encore is clamoured
for</i>; <span class="sc">Wildfire</span> <i>reappears, looking ghastly pale, and makes a mute
plea for indulgence; after he has finally retired, the clamour still
continues, until the scene and the number are shifted</i>.) He won't
sing any more&mdash;how sad! Wasn't he charming with that child?
(<i>In an undertone.</i>) Why, <span class="sc">Althea</span>, darling!</p>

<p><i>Alth.</i> (<i>in a shaken voice</i>). D&mdash;don't speak to me just yet,
<span class="sc">Cissie</span>.
I know it's very foolish of me; but I can't bear it.</p>

<p><i>Capt. Alch.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Gad, I'd give somethin' to sing like
that Johnny, and make her eyes shine like that!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. M.</i> <span class="sc">Frank</span>, we may as well go now, there's nothing else
worth staying for, and I'm sure this horrid tobacco is ruining my
poor pearls; or would you rather stay a little longer, <span class="sc">Thea</span>?</p>

<p><i>Alth.</i> Oh, no, no; I don't want to hear anybody else&mdash;after that.
(<i>To herself, as</i> Capt. A. <i>helps her on with her cloak</i>.) And that is
the man Mr. <span class="sc">Curphew</span> said nothing would induce him to go and
see. And I actually persuaded myself that&mdash;&mdash; But I am wiser
now. He can never be anything to me!</p>

<h2 class="sans">OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Colonel Colvile</span> chivalrously takes upon himself responsibility
for the title of the volume in which his wife has recorded their joint
experience of a trip round the coast of Africa. <i>Round the Black
Man's Garden</i> is about as bad a title as a book could have. Happily,
Mrs. <span class="sc">Colvile's</span> clever travel notes triumphantly carry the weight.
The travellers commenced their journey at Suez, visiting places in
the Red Sea which voyagers by the P. and O. steamers pass by
on the other side. They made their way down the west coast by all
the most uncomfortable means of conveyance attainable, culminating
in the filanzana, in which instrument of torture they were carried
across the hills and through the swamps of Madagascar. Colonel
<span class="sc">Colvile</span>, just now enjoying himself amid the privations of the
journey up country to Uganda, is well known as an indomitable
traveller. In Mrs. <span class="sc">Colvile</span> he found a worthy companion. On a
merry page of the narrative of life in Madagascar, it is incidentally
mentioned that the travellers arrive at Malatsy with their luggage
soaking after a dip in the river. They dine in a whitewashed hut,
with an army of big cockroaches overrunning the walls. Resuming
their journey next morning they "entered a dense cloud of
singularly malignant little black flies." The half-naked porters
were soon streaming with blood, and the passengers' faces were in a
similar condition. "Luckily," writes Mrs. <span class="sc">Colvile</span>, in her cheery
way, "we were soon clear of the infested belt, to move in the course
of half-an-hour into a flight of locusts." Mrs. <span class="sc">Colvile</span> takes as the
motto of her book the proverb, <i>Qui suit son chemin arrive à la fin</i>.
My Baronite arrived at the end of Mrs. <span class="sc">Colvile's</span> fascinating narrative
full of admiration for her courage and good temper. But as
long as Piccadilly and Pall Mall are not "up," he will be content
with them, and would rather not follow her road.</p>

<ul class="none">

<li><i>Question.</i> I suppose your chief desire is
to make as much out of the public as possible?</li>

<li><i>Answer.</i> I suppose it is.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> And you will be as glad to attain your
object by politeness as by any other method?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Well, of course it don't matter to me
how I get the coin, so long as I do get it.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Precisely. Well, have you ever tried
to be polite?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Never. Don't know exactly what the
word represents.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> So I thought. Well, I will attempt
to teach you its meaning by example.</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Thank you; so long as it helps me, and
don't hurt you, what's the odds?</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Certainly; I see that you have some rudimentary knowledge
of the matter already. Well, to begin. Suppose a fare gave you
less than what you considered your right charge, how would you
behave?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> If a policeman wasn't in the way, I should say "What's
this?" and glare at him indignantly.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Have you found this a successful method of obtaining an
increase?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Well, no, not much. Of course if you get an old lady, or a
mother with a heap of children, you can do almost anything with
them.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> But let us take a smart cavalry officer, who knows his way
about town, do you think the method you suggest would be successful
with him?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> No, I don't; but no cavalry officer who was really smart
would offer me less than my fare.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> But we are assuming that there may be some question about
the fare. For instance, what would you consider the right charge
from Charing Cross railway-station to the St. James's Theatre?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Why, eighteen pence, to be sure, and a cheap eighteen pence
in the bargain.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Your computation of the charge will suit my purpose. Of
course, you know that the police put the distance at something less
than two miles, I may say considerably less?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> I daresay they do, but the police are not everybody, and you
said I was not to consider the constables if they weren't on the spot.
If they were, of course that would make a difference.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Assume you get a shilling. Now suppose you were to look at
the coin, and to say, "I beg your pardon, Sir, but are you aware this
shilling is a George the Fourth, or a well-preserved William the
Fourth, or an early Victoria, would you not like to exchange it for
one of less historical interest?" Do you not think that such a speech,
with a civil touch of the hat, would immediately attract attention?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> It might, but I can't say for certain, as I have never tried it.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> I did not suppose that you had. Do you not believe that were
you to make such a remark your kind consideration would receive
attention?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Quite as likely as not, but what then?</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Well, having established yourself on a friendly footing, could
you not improve the occasion by adding, "I do not know whether
you are aware of the fact, Sir, but I frequently receive eighteen
pence for the very distance you have just travelled?"</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Of course I could, but what good would it be?</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> That you will probably find out if you act on my suggestion,
and now, as I have taught you enough for to-day, I will adopt a
driver's phrase and "pull up." Have you anything polite to say to
me which will prove to me that you have been bettered by my instruction?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Nothing that I can think of, unless it be, "Thank you for
nothing."</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> That is scarcely the reply I had expected. However, do not
be disheartened, to thank me at all is a move in the right direction.
And now you will come again?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Well, yes, when I have nothing better to do.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> I am infinitely obliged to you. I will detain you no longer.
Good-bye, and I hope you will adopt my method and find it
successful.</li>

<li><i>A.</i> I hope so, too. But there's no telling.</li>

<h2 class="sans">THE ADVENTURES OF PICKLOCK HOLES.</h2>

<h4>(<i>By Cunnin Toil</i>.)</h4>

<h3>No. VI.&mdash;THE UMBROSA BURGLARY.</h3>

<p>During one of my short summer holidays I happened to be spending
a few days at the delightful riverside residence of my friend <span class="sc">James
Silver</span>, the extent of whose hospitality is only to be measured by the
excellence of the fare that he sets before his guests, or by the varied
amusements that he provides for them. The beauties of Umbrosa
(for that is the attractive name of his house) are known to all those
who during the summer months pass up (or down) the winding
reaches of the Upper Thames. It was there that I witnessed a series
of startling events which threw the whole county into a temporary
turmoil. Had it not been for the unparalleled coolness and sagacity
of <span class="sc">Picklock Holes</span> the results might have been fraught with disaster
to many distinguished families, but the acumen of <span class="sc">Holes</span> saved the
situation and the family-plate, and restored the peace of mind of one
of the best fellows in the world.</p>

<p>The party at Umbrosa consisted of the various members of the
<span class="sc">Silver</span> family, including, besides Mr. and Mrs. <span class="sc">Silver</span>, three
high-spirited
and unmarried youths and two charming girls. <span class="sc">Picklock
Holes</span> was of course one of the guests. In fact, it had long since
come to be an understood thing that wherever I went <span class="sc">Holes</span> should
accompany me in the character of a professional detective on the lookout
for business; and <span class="sc">James Silver</span> though he may have at first resented
the calm unmuscularity of my marvellous friend's immovable
face would have been the last man in the world to
spoil any chance of sport or excitement by refraining
from offering a cordial invitation to <span class="sc">Holes</span>.
The party was completed by <span class="sc">Peter Bowman</span>, a
lad of eighteen, who to an extraordinary capacity
for mischief, added an imperturbable cheerfulness
of manner. He was generally known as Shock-headed
<span class="sc">Peter</span>, in allusion to the brush-like
appearance of his delicate auburn hair, but his
intimate friends sometimes addressed him as
<span class="sc">Venus</span>, a nickname which he thoroughly deserved
by the almost classic irregularity of his Saxon
features.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;"><a href="images/213-700.png"><img src="images/213-400.png" width="400" height="469" alt="Propelled by an athletic young fellow." /></a>
<p class="center">"Propelled by an athletic young fellow."</p></div>

<p>We were all sitting, I remember, on the riverbank,
watching the countless craft go past, and
enjoying that pleasant industrious indolence which
is one of the chief charms of life on the Thames.
A punt had just skimmed by, propelled by an
athletic young fellow in boating costume. Suddenly
<span class="sc">Holes</span> spoke.</p>

<p>"It is strange," he said, "that the man should
be still at large."</p>

<p>"What man? Where? How?" we all exclaimed
breathlessly.</p>

<p>"The young puntsman," said <span class="sc">Holes</span>, with an
almost aggravating coolness. "He is a bigamist,
and has murdered his great aunt."</p>

<p>"It cannot be," said Mr. <span class="sc">Silver</span>, with evident
distress. "I know the lad well, and a better
fellow never breathed."</p>

<p>"I speak the truth," said <span class="sc">Holes</span>, unemotionally. "The induction
is perfect. He is wearing a red tie. That tie was not
always red. It was, therefore, stained by something. Blood is red.
It was, therefore, stained by blood. Now it is well known that the
blood of great aunts is of a lighter shade, and the colour of that tie
has a lighter shade. The blood that stained it was, therefore, the
blood of his great aunt. As for the bigamy, you will have noticed
that as he passed he blew two rings of cigarette-smoke, and they
both floated in the air <i>at the same time</i>. A ring is a symbol of
matrimony. Two rings together mean bigamy. He is, therefore,
a bigamist."</p>

<p>For a moment we were silent, struck with horror at this dreadful,
this convincing revelation of criminal infamy. Then I broke out:</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Holes</span>," I said, "you deserve the thanks of the whole community.
You will of course communicate with the police."</p>

<p>"No," said <span class="sc">Holes</span>, "they are fools, and I do not care to mix
myself up with them. Besides, I have other fish to fry."</p>

<p>Saying this, he led me to a secluded part of the grounds, and
whispered in my ear.</p>

<p>"Not a word of what I am about to tell you. There will be a
burglary here to-night."</p>

<p>"But, <span class="sc">Holes</span>," I said, startled in spite of myself at the calm
omniscience of my friend, "had we not better do something; arm
the servants, warn the police, bolt the doors and bar the windows,
and sit up with blunderbusses&mdash;anything would be better than this
state of dreadful expectancy. May I not tell Mr. <span class="sc">Silver</span>?"</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Potson</span>, you are amiable, but you will never learn my methods."
And with that enigmatic reply I had to be content in the meantime.</p>

<p>The evening had passed as pleasantly as evenings at Umbrosa
always pass. There had been music; the Umbrosa choir, composed
of members of the family and guests, had performed in the drawing-room,
and <span class="sc">Peter</span> had drawn tears from the eyes of every one by his
touching rendering of the well-known songs of "<i>The Dutiful Son</i>"
and "<i>The Cartridge-bearer</i>." Shortly afterwards, the ladies retired
to bed, and the gentlemen, after the customary interval in the
smoking-room, followed. We were in high good-humour, and had
made many plans for the morrow. Only <span class="sc">Holes</span> seemed pre-occupied.
Once I heard him muttering to himself, "It's bound to come
off properly; never failed yet. They wired to say they'd be here
by the late train. Well, let them come. I shall be ready for
them." I did not venture at the time to ask him the meaning of
these mysterious words.</p>

<p>I had been sleeping for about an hour, when I was suddenly
awakened with a start. In the passage outside I heard the voices
of the youngest <span class="sc">Silver</span> boy and of <span class="sc">Peter</span>.</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Peter</span>, old chap," said <span class="sc">Johnny Silver</span>, "I believe there's
burglars in the house. Isn't it a lark?"</p>

<p>"Ripping," said <span class="sc">Peter</span>. "Have you told your people?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's no use waking the governor and the mater; we'll do
the job ourselves. I told the girls, and they've all locked themselves
in and got under their beds, so they're safe. Are you ready?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Come on then."</p>

<p>With that they went along the passage and down the stairs. My
mind was made up, and my trousers and boots were on in less time
than it takes to tell it. I went to <span class="sc">Holes's</span> room and entered. He
was lying on his bed, fully awake,
dressed in his best detective suit,
with his fingers meditatively extended,
and touching one another.</p>

<p>"They're here," I said.</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"The burglars."</p>

<p>"As I thought," said <span class="sc">Holes</span>,
selecting his best basket-hilted life-preserver
from a heap in the middle of the room.
"Follow me silently."</p>

<p>I did so. No sooner had we reached the landing,
however, than the silence was broken by a
series of blood-curdling screams.</p>

<p>"Good Heavens!" was all I could say.</p>

<p>"Hush," said <span class="sc">Holes</span>. I obeyed him. The
screams subsided, and I heard the voices of my
two young friends, evidently in great triumph.</p>

<p>"Lie still, you brute," said <span class="sc">Peter</span>, "or I'll
punch your blooming head. Give the rope another
twist, <span class="sc">Johnny</span>. That's it. Now you cut and
tell your governor and old <span class="sc">Holes</span> that we've
nabbed the beggar."</p>

<p>By this time the household was thoroughly
roused. Agitated females and inquisitive males
streamed downstairs. Lights were lit, and a remarkable
sight met our eyes. In the middle of the
drawing-room lay an undersized burglar, securely
bound, with <span class="sc">Peter</span> sitting on his head.</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Johnny</span> and I collared the beggar," said
<span class="sc">Peter</span>, "and bowled him over. Thanks, I think I could do a
ginger-beer."</p>

<p>The man was of course tried and convicted, and <span class="sc">Holes</span>, who had
explained how he had been certain that the burglary was contemplated
and had taken his measures accordingly, received the
thanks of the County Council.</p>

<p>"That fellow," said the great detective to me, "was the best and
cleverest of my tame team of country-house burglars. Through
him and his associates I have fostered and foiled more thefts than I
care to count. Those infernal boys nearly spoilt everything.
<span class="sc">Potson</span>, take my advice, never attempt a master-stroke in a house
full of boys. They can't understand scientific induction. Had they
not interfered I should have caught the fellow myself. He had
wired to tell me where I should find him."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Darlings</span>, I am growing old,</p>
<p>Silver threads among the gold.</p>
<p>Cannot see beyond my nose,</p>

<p>At the fair I bought a pair,</p>
<p>Golden rimmed, of pebbles rare,</p>
<p>Paid the money then and there,</p>
<p>Glad my spectacles to wear.</p>
<p>But, how strange! I could not see</p>
<p>What was just in front of me!</p>
<p>Took them off and rubbed them well;</p>
<p>Cleaned they seemed; but, strange to tell,</p>
<p>When I put them on again</p>
<p>Everything was plain as plain,</p>
<p>But reflected from behind!</p>
<p>Then I found that tho' so blind,</p>
<p>Many little things I saw</p>
<p>Which I had not seen before.</p>
<p>First, my page, of doubtful age,</p>
<p>Put me in a dreadful rage;</p>
<p>Dipped his fingers in the cream;</p>
<p>(Turned and faced him&mdash;made him scream!)</p>
<p>Dropped the pot, upset a lot&mdash;</p>
<p>Caught it from me pretty hot.</p>
<p>Next the footman kicked my cat</p>
<p>Sleeping on its lamb's-wool mat.</p>
<p>Loosed my dicky from its cage</p>
<p>(Shall deduct this from his wage).</p>
<p>When the housemaid scrubbed the floor,</p>
<p>Watched her through the open door</p>
<p>At my eldest making eyes.</p>
<p>Packed her off to her surprise,</p>
<p>Heeding not her tears and cries.</p>
<p>Truly blindness makes one wise!</p>
<p>Then I caught my little son</p>
<p>Putting mustard in a bun;</p>
<p>Going to give it to the pug.</p>
<p>Seized him by the nearest lug,</p>
<p>Boxed it hard. He howled with pain;</p>
<p>Never teased the dog again.</p>
<p>Saw my girl of twenty-three</p>
<p>Kiss the curate, after tea.</p>
<p>Sent the pair to right about.</p>
<p>(Wondered how I found them out!)</p>
<p>So, you see, I really find</p>
<p>Much amusement of a kind.</p>

<h2 class="sans">A WALK IN DEVON.</h2>

<h3>PART II.&mdash;THE FINISH.</h3>

<h4><i>Notes from the Travel Diary of Toby, M.P.</i></h4>

<p class="indr"><i>The Cottage, Burrow-in-the-Corner, Devon.</i></p>

<p><span class="sc">Very</span> awkward to have missed the Post; being Saturday night
means delay of twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>"Seen the postman?" I asked Old Gentleman.</p>

<p>"Seed ee two minits ago. Gone up the hill. I'll call him
back."</p>

<p>New idea this. Never remember when just too late for last pillar-box
clearance in London suburb running after postman, bringing
him back, and getting him to make special clearance. Old Gentleman
evidently thought nothing of it; skipped out of garden with
remarkable agility; in middle of road in a twinkling; shouting
"Hi! hi!" and waving green umbrella wildly over his narrow-brimmed
top hat, round which the rime of age modestly lurked.
Postman did not seem at all annoyed; came back promptly, unlocked
box, and trudged off again on his rounds.</p>

<p>Here's where my misfortune began. Way back clear by the
road I had come; inviting lane passed Old Gentleman's house; was
there anyway along it to Burrow-in-the-Corner? "Why, yes,"
said Old Gentleman, whose desire to accommodate was illimitable.
"Follow this lane till you come to four cross roads, then turn to
left, and keep on." Nothing plainer than this: getting used to
four cross roads in these parts; came upon this particular assortment
after quarter of an hour's walk; a sign-post too; so thoughtful;
no difficulty about four cross roads when there's a sign-post.
Walked up to it and round it; not a single letter remaining
intact of the direction. Sign-post older than Old Gentleman with
the umbrella, and not nearly in such state of preservation. Not a
soul in sight; "no footfall breaking silence of closing day." Old
Gentleman said turn to left; so left must be right; take it, and
walk on.</p>

<p>Pretty broad highway; must be main road leading somewhere.
Why not to Burrow-in-the-Corner? Quarter mile off come upon
bifurcation. Which is main road? Instincts of trapper assert themselves;
carefully examine which way traffic mostly goes; not many
cart-ruts, but majority turn to left; that must be the way to
Burrow-in-the-Corner. Take it; find it a ditch between lofty
hedges going up a hill, and then, like the late Duke of York, going
down again. Half a mile of this; then another bifurcation; a
gentle curve, insidious, but unmistakable, one horn of my dilemma
leading to right, the other to left. Take the right this time, by way
of change; leads into a road running at right angles. Should I turn
right or left? Do a little of both in succession; can see nothing of
the lay of country, by reason of wall-like hedges; presently come to
gate in field; country chillingly unfamiliar.</p>

<p>Situation beginning to grow serious; dusk closing in apace. In
spite of it I see my mistake; took the wrong turning when I
examined the traffic-mark; must turn back there, and peg along
the other road; get into narrow lane again; this time, varying
man&oelig;uvre of Duke of York, go down a hill, and then go up again.</p>

<p>Trapper instinct, before alluded to, made me note heap of broken
stones at this particular bifurcation. Here it is; no mistake about
that; take other turning, and press on full speed; can't be more
than two miles now; straight road, and there you are. Can do it
under half-an-hour. Nothing so delightful as walk in country
lane in cool of evening. This particular lane rather long; roads
and lanes cutting off to right and left; at least no bifurcation.
Not a house in sight; every soul in the country apparently turned
in. Cottar's Saturday night, of course; should have thought of that
before; explains everything.</p>

<p>Apparently no end to this road; suddenly seems to disappear;
only a dip down a hill; think at first, from steepness, it must be
road into Tipperton; but Tipperton is miles away. Getting on for
dinner-time; better run down hill; do so; see light flickering at
end; probably The Cottage windows; hum "A light in the window
for me"; find I've no breath to spare for musical entertainments;
shut up, and run. Light comes from farm-house; enter yard
cautiously in case of another dog being there. In the twilight see
second Old Gentleman; this time in his shirt-sleeves, sitting meditatively
on an upturned bucket set on a barn floor. "Is this the
way to Burrow-in-the-Corner?" I ask, a little out of breath. Old
Gentleman stares; perhaps he is deaf; looks deaf, but find he is
only chuckling; repeat question louder. "No," says he, "but
that be;" and he waves a horny hand up the wall of a hill down
which I had scrambled.</p>

<p>For the last twenty minutes I'd been running away from Burrow-in-the-Corner
as if we didn't dine at 7.30.</p>

<p>Old Gentleman not accustomed to seeing joke; made most of this;
when he recovered I learned that if I walked back up hill a mile,
and took first turning to right, I should be on the road to
Burrow-in-the-Corner. Nice pull up hill; kept keen look out for
turn to right; after quarter of hour's rapid walking passed on left
openings of two lanes in close contiguity. Through one I had forty
minutes earlier walked on to this very road. If I had then turned
to left instead of going back I should have
been at The Cottage by this time&mdash;supposing,
of course, the road leads thither.</p>

<p>No use repining; must get on; feeling
peckish; walk in middle of road to make most
of twilight shut out by hedges; can't see time
by watch; doing something more than four
miles an hour. At end of what seems half-hour
am apparently no forrader; no house; no
passer-by; no friendly light over ghostly expanse
peeped at through occasional gates.</p>

<p>Begin to think of story heard the other day.
Belated parson went to take evening service
for friend at church close by post-office where
I made acquaintance of first Old Gentleman.
Only three miles from his own house; after
sermon set off to walk home; thinking of many
things, turned off at wrong point; knew
country pretty well, but darkness came on;
hopelessly lost; found forlornly sitting on a
gate at eleven o'clock by farmer's son fortuitously
delayed on his return home; took
stranger home with him; woke up family, and
gave him shakedown for night.</p>

<p>"It was bad enough, <span class="sc">Toby</span>," rev. gentleman
said, "and might have been worse. But
what rankles most bitterly in my breast at
present day is remark of farmer's wife when
her son shouted up at open window that he
had brought home a clergyman who had lost
his way and wanted a bed. 'Clergyman!' she
cried, with cruel scorn. 'Get away with you.
No clergyman would be out at this time of
night.'"</p>

<p>One comfort it's not raining; rained in
torrents when my friend the parson had his
Sunday night out. Road evidently not leading
towards The Cottage; suppose that once
more I am walking away from it! Trapper
instincts already alluded to have evolved a
plan which I hold in reserve. Remember (or
think I remember) the turns on the way back
to post-office where I made acquaintance of
first Old Gentleman; terrible trudge, but
better than sleeping in ditch or shed; shall
turn back and face it. Halt and hesitate; no
sign of Cottage or other light; hedges are
black shadows; a few feet in front and an
equal distance behind is wall of darkness;
decide to take a hundred paces forward. If
then no sign of habitation shall turn back and
grope way by post-office.</p>

<p>At eightieth pace a turn in the road; a light across the roadway;
then The Cottage, and through the open window, into the dark still
night, floats the music of <span class="sc">Schumann's</span> "<i>Frühlingsnacht</i>." It is
the Cook singing, while the Housemaid spreads the cloth for dinner.</p>

(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
